//replace()
//The replace() method returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. 
//The pattern can be a string or a RegExp, and the replacement can be a string or a function to be called for each match. 
//If pattern is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced.
//The original string is untouched
